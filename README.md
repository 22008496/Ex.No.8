# Aim: To perform the Exploration of Prompting Techniques for Audio Generation
# Algorithm: Explore how various prompting techniques can be used to generate and manipulate audio content (e.g., music, sound effects, voice narration) using AI model

# Prompting Techniques:

# Zero-Shot Prompting
Definition: Provide only a direct instruction or description.

# Example:

“Generate a calming ambient background music for meditation.”

“Create the sound of thunder followed by heavy rain.”

Used when: Model is well-trained on diverse data and doesn’t need context/examples.

# Few-Shot Prompting
Definition: Provide a few examples in the prompt before asking for a similar generation.

# Example:

## Example 1: 
Text: "Once upon a time in a forest..." 
Voice: [Calm, female narrator voice, 60 seconds]

## Example 2:
Text: "The spaceship launched into the void." 
Voice: [Excited, male narrator, 30 seconds]

Now generate:
Text: "The knight raised his sword against the dragon."

Used when: You want consistent style/voice or genre across outputs.

# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
Definition: Guide the model through a reasoning or step-by-step generation process.

# Example:

Step 1: Identify the mood → “Energetic and uplifting”
Step 2: Choose instruments → “Guitar, drums, synth”
Step 3: Compose short melody
Step 4: Add rhythm and harmony
Final: Generate 30 seconds of music based on above.
Used when: Generating structured or layered audio (like music composition).

# Role-Based Prompting
Definition: Assign the model a specific role or persona for generation.

# Example:

“You are a professional audiobook narrator. Read the following text in a suspenseful tone.”

“You are a sound designer creating effects for a horror game.”

Used when: You want tone/style consistency or human-like performance.


# Multi-Modal Prompting
Definition: Combine text prompts with other input modes (image/audio).

# Example:

Upload a short video or image of a rainforest and prompt:

“Generate background sound effects to match this environment.”

Combine text + music prompt:

“Based on this melody [upload audio], generate a hip-hop beat accompaniment.”

Used when: Visual/audio context is needed to complement generation.
